# Notifications

Token Requestor Services sends notifications whenever there is a change in
the status of tokens. Upon receiving a notification, it is recommended to
call the corresponding API to obtain more details about the change.

Before consuming this API, a merchant must be registered with the brand and a previously issued token must exist.

Each notification includes a **signature**, which must be validated by the receiver
to confirm that the notification originates from a legitimate and expected source.
This signature helps verify the authenticity of the message, ensuring it was sent by
Token Requestor Services and not by an unauthorized third party. This strengthens
the security of the process in a simple and effective way.

The signature is a cryptographic value generated from a combination of specific message
data and a secret key. Its purpose is to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the notification, confirming that:

The signature is generally generated through the following process:
- A combination of key data is taken, such as the message content and the date.
- A hash function is applied along with a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver.
- The result is a unique digital signature that the receiver can verify using the same secret key.

To validate the signature, the receiver must recalculate it using the same data and secret key.
If the result matches the received signature, the message is confirmed as legitimate and unaltered.

## Notification receivers

Notifications generated by Token Requestor Services can be received by both a consumer and a site.

Delivery depends solely on the prior configuration made by each:
* If the consumer has configured a notification URL along with their secret key, they will receive the notification.
* If the site also has its notification URL and secret key configured, it will also receive the notification.
* If both are configured, both will receive the notification independently.
* If neither has this configuration, the notification will not be delivered to anyone.

In this way, the system guarantees flexibility in delivery, ensuring that each actor receives the notification only if they are prepared to validate and process it.
