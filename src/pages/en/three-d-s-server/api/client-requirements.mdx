# Requirements for the client to integrate

To integrate with the 3DS Server or 3DS Secure service from Evertec, the merchant or gateway must meet the following requirements to ensure compatibility in the connection:

- **HTTP Headers:** HTTP headers must be set with the following values:

        Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8


- **Authentication:** Any request to the service requires an authentication token. The token must be sent in the HTTP header as a "Bearer Token" according to RFC 6750. 
      
  **Example of a Bearer Token:**

      Authorization:"Bearer 1c6b2cda415f40f6f9f82e24d31d3fa6deb3cbcdd1def686fef7ed721a8abf83"


<Note>
This token is provided by the transactional security administrator.
</Note>

- **Secure communications:** To establish links secured by Transport Layer Security (TLS) between the service and connected clients, the version number must be 1.2 or higher. RSA keys must have a minimum length of 2048 bits.
